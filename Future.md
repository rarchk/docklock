Future Tasks 
===
- Right now, we only support gpg encryption. which has one problem, key has to be there. So we need to expeirment with other encryption frameworks like ssl/tls to do this job, to provide greater flexibility. 

- Another major feature, will be the presence of api which provides zero knowledge persistent store in third party storage services. 

- Encryption is always a constraint, but a necessary one. It hinders many features of an unencrypted corollary. We need to think, of a more subtle way to realize these features. Right now encryption is forced, and not seamless.
